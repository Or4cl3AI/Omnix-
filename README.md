## 3. System Architecture

The Omnix system architecture is designed to be innovative, scalable, and adaptive. It consists of three main layers:

1. **Knowledge Layer:** Storing and managing information, including facts, beliefs, and assumptions.
2. **Reasoning Layer:** Making decisions based on knowledge using reasoning strategies like deduction, induction, and abduction.
3. **Action Layer:** Executing decisions and monitoring outcomes.

The seamless communication among layers allows for dynamic decision-making and adaptability.
